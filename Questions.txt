Explain the concept of Hybrid Mobile App Development
-------
The idea about building apps with web technologies like HTML/JS is that you
can easily get the app spread out on different platforms by using a 
compiler that translates the code to the native language of your device.
-------

Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development
compared to Native App Development
-------
Hybrid Apps
PROS
+Easily spread to different platforms
+You dont need to know different languages for each platform
+It can be deployed on the app-store
+You dont need to change code in multiple languages when adding new features/optimising.
CONS
-Not as fast as native apps.
-You will not have the same in depth ways of using the devices components as native apps.

Native Apps
PROS
+Full acces to the devices components
+It's fast performance
CONS
-It can be expensive if you need to change soemthing in your code and you are on multiple platforms since its many different languages.
-You need to develop the apps for different platforms.

Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an ionic Hybrid Application
-------
Angular controls the logic of the presentation layer. 
The app is build and styled by HTML and CSS
Cordova is used to access the devices native components.
-------

Explain and demonstrate ways to debug Hybrid Mobile Applications Running on a real device
-------
You can easily debug a hybrid app by using your device and webbrowser.
Step by step guide.
1. Enable USB debugging on your device. (You will usually need to enable developer mode first)
2. Open chrome and navigate to chome://inspect
3. Select your device
4. Press inspect and start debugging.

Explain when and why CORS is a problem for Hybrid Mobile Applications
-------
Cross Origin Ressource Sharing (CORS) is a safety feature in modern
browsers that does not allow the website to make an HTTP request to a url that 
is not the same as the root of the site. This can cause problems in Hybrid 
App development when trying to use an API like Google Maps that has a 
different url than the app has when developing it.
There is different ways to solve this problem.
one solution is to make a Access-Control-Allow-Origin * to allow request from all locations
Another is to specify the request to go through a proxy and make the proxy 
talk to the backend instead of you directly.
-------

Explain how and why it is possible for a Hybrid Application to access native phone devices like location, calendar etc.
-------
Hybrid apps use a frameworks like cordova which lets you easily use the devices components. 
Cordova acts as a container for running web applications so you can easily 
use different platforms for your webapp
-------

Explain using an example the "fundamentals" of an ionic application.
-------
See IonicDemo for code
-------

Explain using an example how your Hybrid Application communicates with a backend and how CORS problems were solved (if any)
